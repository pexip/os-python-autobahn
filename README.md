AutobahnPython Package
======================

This folder contains the AutobahnPython package.

To install, do

	git checkout v0.5.2
	python setup.py install

Note that you should use a tagged release like done above, not the current head (unless you are hacking on AutobahnPython itself). The current head might be broken or contain bugs.

To list tagged versions, do

	git tag -l

The package is also available from the Python Package Index (PyPi):

	easy_install autobahn

or to update

	easy_install -U autobahn
